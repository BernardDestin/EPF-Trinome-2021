Preparation:
Place the game board in the centre of the table.
Arrange the pieces as shown in figure 1.
The red player starts, then the players take turns.

Game turn: 
On his turn, a player must move one of his pieces.
- Pyramids move diagonally one space.
- Cubes move vertically or horizontally one space.
- Half-spheres move vertically, horizontally or diagonallyby two squares.
- Special pyramids move an extra space when capturing a piece.
- Special cubes have a joker: they can move out of a red space when aligned with two 
pieces of their player.
- Special half-sphere can only move backwards when every other movement is 
blocked.

Capture :
Capture is done by replacement, i.e. by a piece moving into a square occupied 
by an opponent's piece. 
Note that only pyramids and cubes can capture. 
Half-spheres cannot be captured, but they can be captured.
A captured piece is permanently eliminated from the game board

End of the game :
First possibility: The first player who manages to place
3 different pieces (a half-sphere, a cube and a pyramid) 
on the 3 red squares of his opponent wins the game. When a piece moves on a 
red spaces, it cannot move.
Second possibility: If a player manages to capture all of his 
opponent's pieces of one kind (e.g. all 6 cubes) 
he wins the game immediately.
